        <strong> In 2019, Nigeria had an estimated population of over 200 million people, with many citizens holding multiple identification cards for different government agencies.

            Despite efforts to modernize and streamline citizen records management, challenges such as duplication of efforts, incomplete data, and outdated technology still persists.
            
            The proposed framework for unifying citizen records/management will provide a comprehensive, efficient, and secure system for managing citizen data across multiple government agencies.
            
            This web-based simulation will outline the key components of the framework, the benefits it will bring, the challenges it may face, and the roadmap for implementation.
